* What is the issue?
There are a number of known issues ([[https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/-/issues/258][#258]], [[https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/-/issues/661][#661]], [[https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/-/issues/664][#664]]) related to the mounting of the root and boot partitions by fstab when they should be mounted from the initramfs. There is a merge request (=https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/-/merge_requests/1398=) to address these issues.

* How to tell if your system is impacted
At the moment the fix is not merged, so we are all impacted. However, to verify you can open up =/etc/fstab= and see if it lists the root and boot mount points:
#+begin_example
# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>               <dump>  <pass>
LABEL="pmOS_root"       /       ext4    relatime,data=ordered   0       1
LABEL="pmOS_boot"       /boot   auto    defaults                0       2
#+end_example

When the fix has been merged =/etc/fstab= will have a comment stating that it is not being used to mount boot or root. Having said that, even if the fix has been merged, if the impacted packages have not been upgraded you might still have old artifacts in the boot partition.

* What is the impact?
Sometimes when you boot your device the boot partition will not be mounted. Other times it will be mounted. To test if boot was mounted properly you can simply use the [[https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/mountpoint.1.html][mountpoint(1)]] command.
#+begin_src sh
second-chance:~$ mountpoint /boot
/boot is not a mountpoint
#+end_src

You can see that the contents of what should be in boot were actually written to the root file system in a directory named boot.
#+begin_src sh
second-chance:~$ ls /boot
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

#+begin_example
initramfs-postmarketos-allwinner        sun50i-a64-pinephone-1.1.dtb            uInitrd-postmarketos-allwinner
initramfs-postmarketos-allwinner-extra  uImage-postmarketos-allwinner           vmlinuz-postmarketos-allwinner
#+end_example

There were probably written there during an upgrade, that means that the real =/boot= partition might not have the latest version of those files.

* What to do about it?
You may wish to backup the contents of the =/boot= directory before proceeding. I decided to not assume that the contents of the =/boot= directory are the latest version of those files. I have upgraded several times with this issue and perhaps only some of those times the boot partition was not mounted. I decided to remove the contents of the directory (not the partition) =/boot= and then mount the boot partition manually. After that we will reinstall the packages responsible for these files.

#+begin_src sh
second-chance:~$ sudo rm /boot/*
second-chance:~$ sudo mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /boot
second-chance:~$ ls -lah /boot
#+end_src

The ~apk info --who-owns~ command can be used to identify some of the packages which are responsible for deploying payloads to the boot partition.
#+begin_src sh
second-chance:~$ find /boot -type f -exec apk info --who-owns '{}' \;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

#+begin_example

#+end_example

From the output we can see that we will need to run a fix on at least =device-pine64-pinephone= and =linux-postmarketos-allwinner=. The GitLab issue mentions ~postmarketos-mkinitfs~ and after asking on IRC what packages were responsible for payloads to the boot partition, it was suggested that =postmarketos-mkinitfs= is also important.

Now, let's run the ~apk fix~ command for all three of the identified packages and their dependencies. When typing the command, be careful not to make a typo in any of the package names because nvalid package names will be silently ignored. For that reason, I will run a simulation first so that I may visually verify that all three packages will be reinstalled.

#+begin_src sh
second-chance:~$ apk fix -sr  device-pine64-pinephone linux-postmarketos-allwinner postmarketos-mkinitfs
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

#+begin_example
(1/3) Reinstalling postmarketos-mkinitfs (0.12.2-r0)
(2/3) Reinstalling linux-postmarketos-allwinner (5.7.0_git20200704-r0)
(3/3) Reinstalling device-pine64-pinephone (0.3-r2)
OK: 1413 MiB in 616 packages
#+end_example

After that, drop the simulation flag ~-s~, add the dependency flag ~-d~ and run the command again:
#+begin_src sh
second-chance:~$ sudo apk fix -rd  device-pine64-pinephone linux-postmarketos-allwinner postmarketos-mkinitfs
#+end_src

I omitted the output because the list is quite long.

Now, when I list the contents of =/boot= you can see that many of the payloads were updated:

#+begin_src sh
second-chance:~$ ls -lh /boot
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

#+begin_example

-rw-r--r--    1 root     root       15.7M Jul  5 11:56 vmlinuz-postmarketos-allwinner
#+end_example

* Verify mountpoints

To validate both =/= and =/boot= mountpoints we can use the mountpoint(1)]] command once again.

#+begin_src sh
second-chance:~$ mountpoint / && mountpoint /boot
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

#+begin_example
/ is a mountpoint
/boot is a mountpoint
#+end_example

Another way to verify that mountpoints exist for boot and root is to use the [[https://linux.die.net/man/8/lsblk][lsblk(8)]] command to list the block devices with a =MOUNTPOINT= column.

#+begin_src sh
second-chance:~$ lsblk
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

#+begin_example
NAME         MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE  MOUNTPOINT
mmcblk0      179:0    0 59.5G  0 disk  
├─mmcblk0p1  179:1    0   79M  0 part  /boot
└─mmcblk0p2  179:2    0 59.4G  0 part  
  └─root     254:0    0 59.4G  0 crypt /
mmcblk2      179:32   0 14.7G  0 disk  
├─mmcblk2p1  179:33   0   65M  0 part  
├─mmcblk2p2  179:34   0    1G  0 part  
├─mmcblk2p1  254:1    0   65M  0 part  
└─mmcblk2p2  254:2    0    1G  0 part  
mmcblk2boot0 179:64   0    4M  1 disk  
mmcblk2boot1 179:96   0    4M  1 disk
#+end_example

Note, in my case postmarketOS is deployed to an SD card and my root file system is encrypted. Your output might very depending on your configuration.

There are other ways to validate mountpoints of course, but either of the above methods should provide you with sufficient confidence that boot and root are mounted correctly.

* After thoughts
Until this issue is fixed, you will want to double check that =/boot= is mounted before running ~apk upgrade -a~. otherwise, the updated initramfs will be deployed to a directory named =/boot= once again, rather than to the boot partition where it belongs.
