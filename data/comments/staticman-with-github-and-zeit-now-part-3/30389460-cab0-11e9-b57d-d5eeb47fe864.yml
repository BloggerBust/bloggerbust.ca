  I was able to follow your guide successfully until (and including) the
  "connect" part where the bot account accepts the collaborator invitation.
  Unfortunately, I have not been able to post comments since I am getting a 500
  error without any details on the response or in the logs. I am puzzled, since
  I had v2 working with the staticman service before it went bad, so the client
  code should be ok (with the only change being the endpoint). Any hints as to
  where to begin looking? Thanks.
