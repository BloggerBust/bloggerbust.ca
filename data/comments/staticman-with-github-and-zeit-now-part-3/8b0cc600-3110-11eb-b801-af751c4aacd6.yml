message: "Hi Anatoliy,\r\n\r\nI have been meaning to update my Staticman fork for a while now. I am a bit busy at the moment, but I will try to fit it in over the next few weeks. In the meantime, if you want to try and trouble shoot this yourself, you need to access the server side logs to see what is going wrong. Here is the relevant documentation to get you started:\r\n\r\nhttps://vercel.com/docs/platform/deployments#logs\r\n\r\nI will comment here after I have updated my fork.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
