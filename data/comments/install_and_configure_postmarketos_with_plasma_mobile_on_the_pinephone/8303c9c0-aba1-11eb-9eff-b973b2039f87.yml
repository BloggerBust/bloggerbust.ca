  This page was a great help.  I'm on Public Mobile and out of the box could
  make a call and receive SMS, but could not view or send SMS.  So far I've used
  this to get SMS properly working.  Now I'm working on getting the cellular
  data working on my phone.  I have found that working with Manjaro Plasma that
  restarting the ofono service with 'sudo systemctl restart ofono' doesn't seem
  to implement the changes.  From what I'm seeing it does parse the gprs file
  and revert's the file if it's not happy with it.  But in order for me to see
  if it recognizes the contexts often I have to reboot the whole phone.
