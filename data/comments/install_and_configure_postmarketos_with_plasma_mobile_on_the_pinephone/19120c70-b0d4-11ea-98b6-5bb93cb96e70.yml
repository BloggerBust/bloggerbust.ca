message: "Thank you Darcy & Lukasz!\r\n\r\nI enjoyed writing this article and I plan on improving it with more updates. It is not meant as a terse step by step guide for an audience that wants to get their phone up and running as quickly as possible. PostmarketOS + Plasma Mobile isn't ready for that sort of use-case anyway. Instead, it is an account of my own learning and exploration, written in a slight conversational tone, and is intended for those that would like to better understand how things work.\r\n\r\nIf either of you have any suggestions for improvements please let me know. I have already received valuable feedback from #postmarketOS (irc.freenode.net) and #pinephone (irc.pine64.org) channels. Thank you everyone for your tips and suggestions."
