We are raising our service by 22 % on April 15th, but if we chat before then, you’ll be locked in at the current amount. We can chat here:\r\n\r\nhttps://bit.ly/empathyfirm-30-minute-meeting\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nGrant\r\n\r\nPS - I will not see your response so if you have a question, book a time to chat (:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN6565 Shorewood Hills Rd.
