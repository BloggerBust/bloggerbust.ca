  Hi Trevor, many thanks for your blog. Could you possibly advise me whether I
  can disable the login prompt that comes up on the 3.5mm jack? My intention is
  to just use the pinephone as a portable terminal that I can communicate via
  TTL-RS232 to Arduino (STM32) processors in the field. I have written a .tcl
  script to communicate and the data goes out of the pinephone fine, however
  data into the pinephone causes the login prompt to appear. Can ttyS0 not be
  used as a basic UART? Best regards, Andrew
