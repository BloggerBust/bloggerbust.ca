message: "Hey,\r\n\r\nThis Feb I’ll get you on 3 podcasts/mo + 15 professionally edited short-form videos for social media (from the podcasts) + 3 features in online publications/mo - done for you.\r\n\r\nWe’ve helped 37 clients do just that to build their thought leadership in their specific industry which has helped them:\r\n\r\n- Generate more appointments\r\n- Close at a higher % (Because they built authority before the meeting even started)\r\n- Charge higher amounts because people view their company as a premium option \r\n\r\nInterested? We are raising our service by 30 % on Feb 29th, but if we chat before then, you’ll be locked in at the current amount. We can chat here:\r\n\r\nhttps://bit.ly/empathyfirm-30-minute-meeting\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nGrant\r\n\r\nPS - I will not see your response so if you have a question, book a time to chat (:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN6565 Shorewood Hills Rd. Lake Mills WI, 53551\r\nEmail unsubnow1@gmail.com with your website to “unsub” meaning you will not hear from me again."
