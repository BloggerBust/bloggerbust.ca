message: "Hi N!,\r\n\r\nThanks for commenting. Screen is a popular choice. I run the exwm windows manager; that means all of my applications run within an Emacs environment. Screen's default key bindings conflict with Emacs's default key bindings. It is easy enough to customize, but I think SOcket CAT is a great \"no fuss\" alternative.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
