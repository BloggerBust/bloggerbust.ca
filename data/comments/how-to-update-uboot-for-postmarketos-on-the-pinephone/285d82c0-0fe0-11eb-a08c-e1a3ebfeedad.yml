message: "Hi Nadja,\r\n\r\nAre you familiar with IRC? I encourage you to join #pinephone at irc.pine64.org if you haven't already. You should also consider connecting to the freenode and oftc IRC servers. There you will find many open source and free software community channels where you can ask questions and connect with others that share your interest. In case you are not familiar with IRC I provided links to each server's IRC web portal. Web clients are convenient when you are first becoming familiar with IRC, but if you are going to spend a lot of time on IRC you will most likely be happier with a desktop client.\r\n\r\nFor TLS use port 6697. Here are some relevant resources to get you started:\r\n\r\nPine64:\r\n\r\n* website: https://www.pine64.org/\r\n* server: irc.pine64.org\r\n* web client: https://www.pine64.org/web-irc/\r\n\r\nFreenode:\r\n\r\n* website: https://freenode.net/\r\n* server: irc.freenode.net\r\n* web client: https://webchat.freenode.net/\r\n\r\nOFTC:\r\n\r\n* website: https://www.oftc.net/\r\n* server: irc.oftc.net\r\n* web client: https://webchat.oftc.net/\r\n\r\nList of IRC  clients:\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients\r\n\r\nHappy hacking!"
