message: "Hello Trevor,\r\n\r\nyou did a great job exlaining the pinephone boot procedure, I enjoyed working through your post! I am a not-so-skilled linux enthusiast and the pinephone is challening me to deepen my understanding of the unix architecture overall. Your posts are a good source of knowledge throughout this way. Thank you and have a pleasant week."
