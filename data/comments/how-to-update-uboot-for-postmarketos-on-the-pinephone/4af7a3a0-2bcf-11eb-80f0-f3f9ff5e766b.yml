message: "Now. I'm waiting for my pynephone, but the mine brings Majanro GNU/Linux distro (Arch-linux based) y want change every thing in it. \r\n\r\nI have used Kubuntu, Ubuntu, Archlinux, Artix linux, Linux Mint, Red-hat (very few, in a server), Debian and now Devuan for the las 3 years. I was 100% kde, but since the last 2 years i use i3-wm i am falled in love with kde software, but i love use that software on the i3-wm simplicity and structure. Ten years being GNU/Linux user, enought for undestanding that science is being revolutionated and powered by GNU&Linux togeter.\r\nNow I want to try i3-wm on my pinephone, i hope. \r\n\r\nNever before used GNU/Linux on arm architecture. I will learn and it is exciting."
