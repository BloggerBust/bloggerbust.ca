message: "Hi Nadja,\r\n\r\nThank you for the complement. I am glad to that you enjoyed learning a bit about u-boot and the PinePhone's boot procedure. Let me tell you a little bit about how I learned to learn about GNU/Linux, programming and computer technology in general.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in elementary my dad purchased an <a ref=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIc\">APPLE IIC</a> and gave it to me and my siblings as a Christmas Gift. I asked my mom take me to the local library in search of programming books. I checked-out every book on Applesoft BASIC. Each book contained the source code for a number of programs. I typed out every symbol and character until the program finally ran. I had absolutely no idea what I was doing, but I discovered that I could change values in the program and that would affect the programs output. Eventually I was able to write my own simple programs. My parents were both very busy and did not know anything about computers. They were happy to check books out of the library for me, but the reading and understanding of those books was my own responsibility. I was in grade 2 at the time. That computer meant everything to me.\r\n\r\nWhile I was in high school I became curious about Linux. Or at least, I became curious about this other operating system that used something called the Linux kernel. In fact, I became curious about what that word, kernel, actually meant. I didn't have any computer literate friends and I did not realize that there was a local Linux enthusiast group that I could have connected with. I purchased a copy of Linux Mandrake from a nearby computer shop and followed the supplied instructions to dual boot my Intel 486 with Windows 95 and Mandrake. I naively explored the default suite of applications through the Gnome windows manager. When I found the terminal I was delighted to discover that the commands were completely different than DOS or Applesoft DOS. A whole new world to explore. The experience captured my attention, but I had a lot to learn.\r\n\r\nBy the time I enrolled in computer science at University I already had a full year of professional C++ development experience; However, my target platform was for the most part Microsoft Windows. At University the work stations all ran Sun Solaris. One of my courses required students to purchase Unix in a Nutshell (O'Reilly). I learned to use emacs. I took a cyber philosophy course and read: The Cathedral & The Bazaar by Eric S. Raymond, Out of Control by Kevin Kelly, Life On The Screen by Sherry Turkle and A Gift of Fire by Sara Baase. I learned about the Open Source movement, the Free Software movement and developed a deeper understanding about the relationship between humans and technology. I learned about Vivisystems, emergent behaviour and the cybernetic principal. I was inspired to learn more.\r\n\r\nI met other students that were only running GNU/Linux at home and they knew the command line much better than I did. That weekend I formatted the drive on my Pentium desktop and performed a stage-1 install of Gentoo Linux, only this time it was not dual booted. By forcing myself to use Linux every day, and by being in an environment where others were doing the same, my fluency with Linux shell commands and programming improved. The most significant thing I learned was how to find what I needed to know to solve whatever problem I was faced with. University provided me with plenty of problems to solve and those problems gave my desire to learn a purpose.\r\n\r\nI am not suggesting that you need to go to University to find purpose. I am suggesting that finding a purpose might help to guide your learning by narrowing the scope a bit. In my early years I had no purpose to guide my learning. What I did have was a powerful motivation to learn about computers and programming, but those are very broad topics.\r\n\r\nTo learn you need to know where to begin. To begin you need a purpose."
