message: "Thank you so much for commenting Ricardo!\r\n\r\ni3-wm is a fabulous windows manager. Before switching to exwm I was an advocate of fvwm. I enjoyed writing scripts for fvwm and extending its capabilities. I still like fvwm, but my passion for Emacs grew to the point that fully immersing my user-land experience within emacs was a natural progression. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of Emacs, I am looking forward to EmacsConf on November 28th and 29th. For those that are interested, here are the details: https://emacsconf.org/2020/\r\n\r\nIf you do setup i3-wm on your PinePhone, I would love to hear about your experience doing so.\r\n\r\nAll the best!"
