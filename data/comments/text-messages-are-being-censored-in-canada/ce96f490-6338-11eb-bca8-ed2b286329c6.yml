message: "Hello OldFart,\r\n\r\nI am able to send both of the URLs that you mentioned via SMS between two phones on my personal plan. I will test between different carrier services and regions over the next week.\r\n\r\n- Which protocols are affected?\r\n- Did you keep track of which carriers, regions and devices are affected and which are not?\r\n- May you please share any facts you have collected? (Feel free to email me using my public key)\r\n\r\nBy the way, you are not the only person that has been contacting me about URLs that cannot be sent by SMS. With permission, I will include a portion of my correspondence in my next post to this comment section.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, I do not believe that the text \"secure communication\" (referring to the blog post) is being censored. I am still investigating other possible explanations."
