message: "With permission, I am able to share some anonymous details regarding a correspondent's experience trying to share a URL to a website that was hosting a collection of videos by Ty and Charlene on vaccines. I have been able to send text (SMS, MMS) containing the links mentioned below, therefore I cannot corroborate my correspondent's claim. If that changes, I will post an update.\r\n\r\nDo not be offended by those that challenge your world view. Instead, be offended by those with intent to suppress that challenge.\r\n\r\nHi trevor, \r\nYes both phones were android\r\nMy phone is a J7 Refine Samsung android version 9.0 Pie\r\nMy friends phone is a samsung A20 android 9.0 Pie also. \r\nMy carrier is boost mobile which is basically Sprint and my friends carrier is tmobile. We both reside in [REDACTED]. \r\n\r\nThe link which was censored was the following:\r\n\r\nhttp://mapp.thetruthaboutvaccines.com/a/1067/click/2826/882701/24dac97f05812700bab7547619199b6c3fcfdba6/4d42044e60a94f829905053fc173abaec1512dbe\r\n\r\nIt's a link for the videos done by Ty and Charlene on vaccines.\r\n\r\n I also tried to send to about 8 other people that same day and no one received. (Every time i sent, my phone showed the sent message of the link twice in my texting app, if i remember correctly, and that's what still happens usually when something is blocked). So that would have been a mixture of androids and iphones. The above censored text was only sent from my phone. \r\n The following day, i tried to send it to my boss while in the same room. I sent a text preceding the censored link and said that the link was coming, then i sent the link, and then sent a follow up text. I looked at my boss's Windows 10 phone. It received the preceding text and follow up text but not the link. I then put a space [in the link] between the word vaccine and resent and then it went thru. That is the same test i did with my friend above. Exact same thing happened. \r\n The same day my friend had a different link for the same vaccine videos, but the link did not have the word vaccine like mine did. We only tested it from my friend's phone to mine. I did not try sending it back. Here is the link: \r\n\r\nhttps://bit.ly/3av \r\n\r\nMy friend followed the same testing procedure as I just described and I did not get the link, but always got the preceding and followup text. But when she put a space somewhere in the link, it came thru to my phone. So we gathered that the vaccine vids where being censored. It makes sense because the documentary is very damaging to the drug and vaccine companies.\r\n\r\n  A while after that, probably about a month, tmobile went down all over the US and they suggested using Messenger or Signal to talk with people who had tmobile phones. So i got the signal app and learned it was an encryption app. So i had an idea to see if it would encrypt the blocked link. I first made sure the blocked link was still being censored by using the above test and using my standard messaging app. It was still censored. Then my friend and I both installed signal and made it the default messaging app. I texted the link and it did go thru! So by that we gathered that they were for sure censoring that link.\r\n\r\nYes of course u can use the information anonymously."
